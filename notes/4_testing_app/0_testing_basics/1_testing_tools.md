## what is test framework?

- to write tests we need testing framework.
- testing frameworks give library having "utitily function" to write tests and "test runner" to run tests from command line

## Popular testing Frameworks are :

1. Jasmine :
   - one of early player in this space.
2. Mocha :
   - it's most popular framework on npm.
   - but by design it doesn't include certain features which are present in other libraries to we need to use it with plugins like "Chai" and "Sinon"
3. Jest :
   - It's newer framework backed and used by facebook.
   - jest is a wrapper around Jasmine with some extra code coverage tool.
